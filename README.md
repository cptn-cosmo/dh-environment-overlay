# Daggerheart Environment Overlay

A FoundryVTT module for the **Daggerheart** system that allows GMs to link **Environment** type actors to specific scenes. When a linked scene is active, the environment actor's token is displayed as an interactive, persistent overlay on the canvas.

## Features

- **Interactive Overlay**: Click the overlay to instantly open the Environment actor's sheet.
- **Movable Interface**: Hold `Alt` + Left Click and Drag to reposition the overlay. The position is saved per-scene.
- **Customizable**:
  - Toggle the display of the actor's name.
  - Customize the border color of the overlay token.
- **Permission Support**: The overlay respects ownership permissions, ensuring only relevant users can see or interact with it.
